- Added frmImportTanks. Import function stores file content in a string for now.

23.02.14
- Import Tanks function now writes tanks to DB.
- Remaining:
	- Add status message 'Importing tanks...'
	- Import fails if one or more tankIds alrady exist. Function should be able to append new tanks
	- Add function for truncing the tank table?
- BadButton-Comment 
	- Fixed check for tankIds already exists, but json file method is pretty slow.... ^_^
