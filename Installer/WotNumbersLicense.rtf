\pard\nowidctlpar\qj\lang20\b0 Wot Numbers performs an automatic version control during application startup. If a newer version exists, the user is prompted to download and upgrade. The application also reports usage (player name, server realm and current version) back to the Wot Numbers web server. Such data is only being logged for statistical purposes and will not be shared with other parties.\par
